## The Scroll in *Magic: the Gathering*

As an earlier form of the Book, the use of the scroll in our world was eventually supplanted by the bound, paginated form of the codex. Similarly, in the multiversal setting of *Magic: the Gathering*, the scroll, like the tablet, is sometimes presented in connection to writings from the past. 

"Scroll of Origins" and "Scroll of the Masters" certainly gives the impression that the writing contained in them come from the ancients.

It is notable, however, that in the game's Asian-inspired planes such Kamigawa (Japan) and Tarkir (East Asia), the scroll appears to still be the primary form of the book in their present. There are even characters on these planes whose primary identities are bound with the scroll, such as "Azami, Lady of Scrolls" and "Minamo Scrollkeeper."

Outside of these Asian-inspired planes, however, the scroll seems to appear in very particular contexts such as trade, politics, religion, cartography, and engineering. The cards "Contract from Below" and "Merchant Scroll" represent the transactional utility of the scroll.

"Armistice" and "Bargaining Table" shows the scrolls as being a part of political and mercantile negotiations.

The scroll also appears in the game as a container of divine texts, as in the "Scroll of Avacyn," or infernal texts as in the "Scroll of Griselbrand".

The cards "Cartography" and "Cartographer's Survey" show the scroll as the ideal medium for map-making or cartography.

Finally, "Gerrard's Wisdom" and "Nimblewright Schematic" highlights the use of the scroll for blueprints and schematics.

It goes without saying, of course, that scroll, like all the other forms of the Book that exists within the *Magic: the Gathering* multiverse, can also have magical properties, or give those who wield them powerful abilities such as seen in "Twinscroll Shaman".
