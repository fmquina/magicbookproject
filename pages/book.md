## The Book in *Magic: the Gathering*

While different forms of the Book appear all over the 27,000 or so cards that make up *Magic: the Gathering*'s card pool to date, the most common form is that of the codex or the bound book.

A search on the website [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com), which is a fan-created database of cards in the game, shows that almost 700 cards feature the book in illustrations. And that number is sure to rise, as the game continues to publish new cards every few month or so.

In the multiverse setting of the game, the bound book is sometimes called a book, a tome, or a codex.

Whatever term is used to call the bound book, these artifacts in the game are usually important and powerful items usually tied to a character. Some of these books are even explicit called spellbooks or grimoires.

The so-called "Words" card cycle, which was originally printed in the game's 2002 expansion *Onslaught*, illustrates the magical properties of many of the books in the game. The series is comprised of five cards, one for each of the colors of magic represented in the game, whose illustrations (and mechanics) highlight the power of the bound book in the hands of mage.

But of course it isn't only mages who deal with books in the storyworld of *Magic: the Gathering*. There are those who works with the books such teachers, students, librarians and archivists, even merchants.
