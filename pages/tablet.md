## The Tablet in *Magic: the Gathering* 

In our world, the earliest form of writing researchers have found were done on clay, stone, wax, and wood tablets. In the multiverse setting of *Magic: the Gathering*, we see tablets appear across multiple planes in distinct mediums.

Indeed, the earliest appearance of the tablet in the game was the card "Copper Tablet" which was published in the game's first core set in 1993. A year later, in an expansion called *Antiquities*, we see the publication of "Bronze Tablet."

Although other tablets have appeared in the game since these two, "Copper Tablet" and "Bronze Tablet" are the only two instances where the material of the tablet is mentioned. However, the illustrations that accompany many of these cards does show what appears to be stone or clay tablets. 

It is notable that tablets still do represent a past form of the Book in the storyworld of the game, as can be seen in the cards "Slate of Ancestry," "Inscribed Tablet," and "Mystic Archeologist."

Some tablets in the game also are tied to a place or some form of instution. "Tablet of Epityr,"  for example, refers to a location in the plane of Dominaria, the game's primary setting. "Tablet of the Guildpact," meanwhile refers to the governing body on the plane of Ravnica.

As the game is called *Magic: the Gathering*, it stands to reason that some of the tablets that appear in the game have magical properties. In the 2000 expansion titled *Nemesis*, a card cycle featured tablets being used as magical seals. 

Illustrated by the artist Christopher Moeller, cards featured illustrations of hand breaking the seal, and releasing the magical effect within.

There were five cards in the original card cycle, one for each of the representative colors of magic in the game. In 2007, a new green card was added to the cycle, with Moeller returning as illustrator.
