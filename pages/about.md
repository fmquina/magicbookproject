# About the Project

*Pore Over the Pages* was created by [Francis Quina](https://www.english.pitt.edu/people/francis-quina) for the course "Making and Unmaking the Book" taught by [Dr. Jennifer Waldron](https://www.english.pitt.edu/people/jennifer-waldron) at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.english.pitt.edu), Fall 2024.

The card images were taken from [Scryfall.com](https://scryfall.com). Use of the card images, all of which belong to the game publisher Wizards of the Coast, is in accordance with the company's fan content policy, which are outlined [here](https://company.wizards.com/en/legal/fancontentpolicy).

The artists, whose illustrations appear in the cards, are identified in each item page.

The source for book cover images are listed on each item page, as are the copyright information for these images.

The project was built using [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
