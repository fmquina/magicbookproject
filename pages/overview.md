## Introduction
 
_Pore Over the Pages_ is an exhibit that highlights the intersections of the Book and the collectible card game *Magic: the Gathering*. The Book, both as an object and as a concept, is deeply connected to the game, which draws from modern fantasy literature and media. 

The exhibit features a collection of cards from the game's massive card pool that refers to the Book, either in illustration, text, or game mechanic.

#### The Game

*Magic: the Gathering*, or MTG, is the world's first collectible card game. It was created by [Richard Garfield](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Richard_Garfield) and was first published in 1993. The game was inducted into the [National Toy Hall of Fame](https://www.museumofplay.org/toys/magic-the-gathering/) in 2019 for its innovative design and for ushering in an entirely new genre of toys, the collectible card game. 

The game has also been called one of the most mechanically complex games by the [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/05/07/135482/magic-the-gathering-is-officially-the-worlds-most-complex-game/), citing a scientific journal article that demonstrated that cards from the game can be used to create a playable deck that emulates a Turing-complete computer.
