## The *Magic: the Gathering* Story

The connection between MTG and the Book goes back to its creation in the early 1990s. Richard Garfield, a Math PhD student and aspiring game designer, was asked by the company Wizards of the Coast to create a fast and portable game for people who played fantasy tabletop roleplaying games (Chalk 9). 

Many of these games, like Dungeons and Dragons, draw heavily from modern fantasy literature that was in turn inspired by the works of J.R.R. Tolkein. This fantasy literature connection is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg of the Book’s influence in the game. 

Garfield imagined the game to be a duel between mages or wizards, with the cards representing spells that each could cast. Each player’s deck of cards is a “library” of spells– their literal spellbook. According to Mark Rosewater, the game’s current lead designer, this idea of the card deck as spellbook was emphasized by the design of the card back (Fig 1) as well as the deck box in which starter decks of the game were packaged in (Fig. 2). 

As Rosewater notes in a 2009 blog post,  “the starter deck box itself (back in the days of Alpha) was also designed to look like a tome complete with pages on the side and a bookmark” (n.p.).

Conceptually, this makes sense. The spells a mage has access to is limited by what they have written down in their spellbook; an MTG player can only play cards they put in their deck. This means that players can pick and choose which spells/cards they want to play with, while ignoring all others. The same way a mage might fill their spellbook with only spells they want to  cast.

In the early years of the game, this multiverse included Earth, hence some of the cards in the game refer to the West Asian (Middle East) and Chinese lore. Some of the cards in the game even refered to canonical literary works such as those of Shakespeare. Later, it was decided to keep references to the real world out of the game.   

storyworld was called Dominia. 

This narrative is set in a multiverse   

Since its initial publication, MTG has been regularly updated through the publication of new sets and expansions. These expansions add not only to the game's card pool, which to date, has over 27,000 unique cards, not counting reprintings, but its mechanics as well. ,  

Most of if not all 

Because of its historical significance, as well as scarcity, some MTG cards are sought after by many collectors, with some cards fetching in hundreds of thousands of dollars.
