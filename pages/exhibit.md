## *Magic: the Gathering* & collectible card games
 
*Magic: the Gathering* is a collectible card game created by Richard Garfield and was first published in 1993. MTG, as it is known to its players, is acknowledged as the first collectible card game or CCG, and has since given rise to a new genre of card games which include the *Pokemon Trading Card Game* and *Yu-Gi-Oh!*

Collectible card games are different from other card games in that players do not have immediate access to all the cards used in the game. Where other card games can be purchased in its entirety, CCGs are bought in booster packs that contain a random assortment of game cards. These game cards by themselves are also sorted by rarity, so some cards may appear in a pack more often than other cards. 

This intentional scarcity makes the game unpredictable for players, and at the same time, encourages players and enthusiasts to try and collect the cards, whether to play with them, or to just complete the set.

These games are also constantly updated by the addition of new sets of cards. In the case of MTG, a new set of cards is released every few months to add to the game's card pool. To date, the game has over 27,000 individual cards across more than 70 expansions, with the latest one being released in November 2024.
Because of the size of the card pool and the nature by which players can acquire these cards, it is better to think of MTG (and CCGs, in general) as “game systems” rather than individual games. A game like Uno, for example, can only be played one specific way, the cards working only within the established rules of the game. 

MTG, on the other hand, is played in a variety of so-called formats using a shared card pool and rules governing the game mechanic interaction. For example, MTG can be played in a sealed format, where two players each open a number of booster packs and then create a deck from the cards that they managed to get from those said packs. Another way of playing MTG is taking all the cards you own and from that pool constructing a deck based on some restriction agreed upon by the players.
